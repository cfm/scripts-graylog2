graylog2 systemd scripts
===

Here you can find systemd scripts for latest (v0.20.6) graylog2-server and
graylog2-web. Please note, that these scripts assume couple of things:

* systemd is in version 208 or newer
* graylog2-server is located in /usr/share/graylog-server
* graylog2-web is located in /usr/share/graylog-web
* graylog2-server is running on the same machine as Elasticsearch and MongoDB
(if this is not the case, just remove _Requires_ section from graylog2-server
script)
* scripts are binded to network.target and will fail to start when it's not 
present (both during boot time and when for some reason network.target will go
down)

Please notice that there are no guarantees that hamsters will not eat your
server (nor that those scripts will work for you).
